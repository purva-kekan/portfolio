## 📌 About This Portfolio

This portfolio highlights my work as an **AI Analyst and Data Engineer**, combining Python-based ML pipelines, SQL data transformation, and dashboard design to turn complex operational data into production-ready analytics and AI features.

### ✨ What I Build

🔧 **Data & ML Pipelines:** Multi-source data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and API deployment using Python, SQL, dbt and FastAPI  
🤖 **AI & NLP Systems:** Predictive models, time series forecasting, recommendation systems, and LLM-powered applications for real-world use cases  
📊 **Analytics Infrastructure:** Dashboards, KPIs, and geospatial analytics to support product teams, clinical operations and business intelligence  
🚀 **MLOps Foundations:** Containerized deployments (Docker), experiment tracking, CI/CD for models and monitoring workflows  

### 🎯 Domains I Focus On

- **Healthcare & Public Health:** Forecasting mortality, resource allocation, population health analytics  
- **Travel & Mobility:** Trip recommendation features, safety metrics, multi-source data integration for AI-powered planning  
- **Financial Services:** Risk, compliance and customer analytics with SQL-based ETL and BI reporting
